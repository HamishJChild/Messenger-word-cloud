# Messenger Word Cloud
A word cloud for the top 100 words used on Fb Messenger.
This could be have a simple web web that allows a user to select a person to query from a dropdown (or non) and then produce and view the word cloud.

Another visualisation is a live graph showing who I messaged the most over the years (excluding group chats).

**This has been altered to only use data from 1 year, as the full messenger history was over 23Gb and was taking too long to download.**
